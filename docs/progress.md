# AI Assistant Enhancement Implementation Progress

## Phase 1: Core Action Infrastructure

### Completed:
- Updated config.example.yaml with new action settings
- Implemented ClipboardUtil for clipboard functionality
- Implemented KeyboardAutomation for keyboard shortcuts
- Implemented NotificationManager for confirmations

## Phase 2: Structured Output

### Completed:
- Implemented ResponseProcessor for JSON parsing
- Implemented NotesManager for note-taking
- Updated system prompt for structured output
- Updated AIConnector to use structured responses

## Phase 3: Extensibility

### Completed:
- Implemented ModelConnector abstract base class for model abstraction
- Created GeminiConnector for Gemini API integration
- Created OpenAIConnector for OpenAI API integration
- Implemented ModelFactory for selecting the appropriate model connector
- Created Plugin base class and PluginManager for extensibility
- Added example plugin to demonstrate the plugin architecture
- Updated AIConnector to use the new abstraction layer and plugin system

### Next Steps:
- Update the main application (app.py) to use the new components
- Create comprehensive documentation for the new architecture
- Add unit tests for the new components
- Create additional example plugins to demonstrate functionality

## Implementation Notes

The third phase focused on building a flexible architecture that supports multiple AI models and extensions through plugins. The key components include:

### Model Abstraction Layer
- ModelConnector abstract class defines the interface for all model integrations
- Specific implementations (GeminiConnector, OpenAIConnector) handle provider-specific details
- ModelFactory creates the appropriate connector based on configuration

### Plugin Architecture
- Plugin base class provides a standard interface for all plugins
- PluginManager handles loading, initialization, and execution of plugins
- Plugin system allows for extending the application without modifying core code
- Example plugin demonstrates how to create custom functionality

These enhancements make the application more maintainable and extensible, allowing for:
- Easy addition of new AI model providers
- Custom processing of model responses through plugins
- Extension of functionality without changing core code
