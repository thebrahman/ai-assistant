# AI Assistant Enhancement Implementation Progress

## Phase 1: Core Action Infrastructure

### Completed:
- Updated config.example.yaml with new action settings
- Implemented ClipboardUtil for clipboard functionality
- Implemented KeyboardAutomation for keyboard shortcuts
- Implemented NotificationManager for confirmations

### Next Steps:
- Phase 2: Implement Structured Output components
  - ResponseProcessor for JSON parsing
  - NotesManager for note-taking
  - Update system prompt for structured output
  - Update AIConnector to use structured responses

## Implementation Notes

The first phase focuses on building the core infrastructure needed for actions like copying text to clipboard, executing keyboard shortcuts, and displaying notifications for user confirmation.

### ClipboardUtil
- Uses pyperclip library to copy text to clipboard
- Handles errors gracefully with logging

### KeyboardAutomation
- Built on top of pynput for cross-platform keyboard control
- Supports both key combinations (ctrl+c) and sequences (ctrl+b->x)
- Includes extensive key mapping for special keys

### NotificationManager
- Provides confirmation dialogs with timeout
- Uses threading to prevent blocking the main application
- Will be extended with more notification types in future phases
