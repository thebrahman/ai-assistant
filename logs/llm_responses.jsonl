Any application can easily read any secret if the keyring is unlocked. And, if a user is logged in, then the login/default collection is unlocked. Available D-Bus protection mechanisms (involving the busconfig and policy XML elements) are not used by default and would be easy to bypass anyway.\nThe GNOME project disagrees with this vulnerability report because, according to their stated security model, untrusted applications must not be allowed to communicate with the secret service.\nApplications sandboxed via Flatpak only have filtered access to the session bus.\n1.2 Keyring is not locked when session is locked\nWhen the session is locked, the keyring is not automatically locked.
